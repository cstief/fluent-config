 <b>Configuration files and workflows</b><br><br>
 Apps are organized into folders, which contain configuration files, screenshots, and a Readme explaining the use of each. <br>
 All apps are open source. I recommend using the <a href="https://scoop.sh">Scoop</a> package manager; it is super easy to use and has most of these apps.
