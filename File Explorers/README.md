## Files UWP

This is, in the authors' words, "More than just a rewrite of Windows Explorer". This free and open source explorer can be downloaded from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/files-uwp-preview/9nghp3dx8hdx?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) and the source code can be found on [github.com/duke7553/files-uwp](https://github.com/duke7553/files-uwp).

## Fluent File Explorer

This is the best looking explorer that's available on the market right now, period. It's not free, but if a price worth a couple of cups of coffee doesn't bother you, it can be downloaded from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/fluent-file-explorer/9pcfpnsqjxcg?activetab=pivot:overviewtab).

It offers practically infinite options to customize look and feel, here's an example
