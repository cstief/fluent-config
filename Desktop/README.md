# Desktop Widgets

This can be made using [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/), a free and open-source desktop customization tool for Windows. This Reddit [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainmeter/comments/eva9on/my_take_in_minimalism/) explains how.

If this is too much work, just press Windows key + G to open up the Game Bar to have a peek at the stats.

# Wallpapers

Windows Spotlight offers some unbelievably great looking wallpapers that refresh daily. However, Settings only provide the option to set the lockscreen as Spotlight wallpaper. Using [Dynamic Theme](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/dynamic-theme/9nblggh1zbkw?&activetab=pivot:overviewtab), a free wallpaper app, the homescreen can be set as Spotlight wallpaper too.

# Theme and Colours

The system-wide theme can be switched from Settings.

Make sure to check the 'Choose accent colour automatically' option (it's not checked here for some reason).

This theme can be automatically changed from Light to Dark and back to Light, depending on the time, using this free and open-source tool [github.com/Armin2208/Windows-Auto-Night-Mode](https://github.com/Armin2208/Windows-Auto-Night-Mode)
