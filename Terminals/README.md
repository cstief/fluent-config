# Terminals

## Windows Terminal

[Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) is the official modern replacement for the aged ConHost. It is extremely feature rich and customizable.

Here's the terminal at work - both ligth and dark themes!

My configuration settings for Windows Terminal can be found in the `settings.json` file.

## Fluent Terminal

Before Windows Terminal, [Fluent Terminal](https://github.com/felixse/FluentTerminal/) was the only viable good option for a beautiful terminal experience, so it deserves a mention. It also supports multiple tabs, a settings GUI, SSH and MoSH clients built-in and many other nice features. `config.json` contains my current configuration settings for Fluent Terminal.

## Alacritty

[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) is a GPU-accelerated terminal emulator with a strong focus on simplicity and performance. It does not contain any fancy features but it blazing fast. I use a global NPM module called [alacritty-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/alacritty-themes) for quickly configuring the colorschemes from the commandline. `alacritty.yml` contains my current Alacritty configuration.

Here's a screenshot of both Fluent Terminal and Alacritty running side-by-side:
