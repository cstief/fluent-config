# Visual Studio Code

This popular code editor can be fluent-ified very easily: by just downloading the extension from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eyhn.vscode-vibrancy). The source code can be found here [github.com/eyhn/vscode-vibrancy](https://github.com/eyhn/vscode-vibrancy).

To download VSCode itself, go [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or look at its source [github.com/microsoft/vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).

Here's a look at the Welcome page
